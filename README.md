## Setup

Assuming that a full React Native environment (Campus App does is not Expo based) is already installed (see the _React Native CLI_ section in the [React Native Docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)), follow these steps:

1. clone project with git (`git clone git@github.com:DHBWLoerrach/CampusApp.git`)
2. in terminal, change to CampusApp directory (`cd CampusApp`)
3. install npm packages (preferably by executing `yarn` &mdash; `npm install`
   might also work)
4. copy env.example.js to env.js (here you might need to fill in some data to
   get enable all features &mdash; get in contact with the maintainer of this
   repository)

## Launch app in iOS simulator (Mac only)

XCode needs to be installed.

Open terminal and cd into CampusApp directory. 

`cd ios` and install dependencies with `pod install` (for this you'll need
[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/)) 

Start the React Native Packager: `react-native start`

Now launch Campus App in an iOS simulator: `react-native run-ios`

## Launch app in Android emulator

Please refer to the _React Native CLI_ section in the [React Native Docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)

## Launch app on Android device

See also [React Native Docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/running-on-device)

Make sure Android device is in debug mode (enable developer options) and connect device via USB.

To access the development server from the Android device you need to use 'adb reverse':

`adb -d reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081`

Open terminal/console, cd into CampusApp directory and run

Start the React Native Packager: `react-native start`

Now launch Campus App in an Android emulator: `react-native run-android`
